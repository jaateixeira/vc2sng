## Problem Statement
It is hard to compare two social networks.  Using rich visualization techniques can help with the problem.  

## Vision
A world where: 
1. Comparing the social structure of distinct groups is easier
2. Comparing the social structure of a cohesive group at two points is easier 

## Inputs

## Outputs
A description of the expected results or outputs of the project.

##  How does it work 

## Installation
Instructions on how to install your project.

## Usage
